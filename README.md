This repository is meant to provide a few small exercises to familiarize you with the type of work that we do as developers on the UX Team.

Each sub-folder in the project root is meant to engage your skills in basic HTML/CSS, Nodejs, and Reactjs respectively.

In each, you will find an index file with further instructions, except in the React project folder which contains its own ReadMe.

Pick one to complete fully. If you want to pick a second one, go ahead, but do not spend more than four hours in total on this task.

In order to submit your work, please go ahead and fork this repository, then re-upload it yourself and provide a link to where you have opened your Pull Request with the necessary work for review.
