React Component building test

Using the instructions found at https://design.avayacloud.com/components/web/setup-web, download the Neo CSS library, and use the styles found there to build a Button Component based on the spec
provided at https://design.avayacloud.com/components/web/buttons-web.

This Component should be a React Component that accepts props that render each style or variant according to the examples given on the page above.

For example, the Button should take a property to render the disabled state.

In addition to the above requirements, please write AT LEAST TWO automated tests which are passing for your code.
